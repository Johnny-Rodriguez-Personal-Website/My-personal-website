    <p2>
      My name is Johnny and i like spending time with friends and family. I enjoys bonding with my
      family and friends over shared experiences, whether that be playing games together or simply spending time
      catching up. I values the importance of building strong relationships and cherishes the moments spent with
      those I cares about. When it comes to games, I finds joy in both competitive and cooperative play, relishing
      in the challenge of going head-to-head with friends or working together towards a common goal.
